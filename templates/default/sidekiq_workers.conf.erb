# manage a set of Sidekiqs

# This config should work with Ubuntu 12.04+.  It
# allows you to manage multiple Sidekiq instances with
# Upstart, Ubuntu's native service management tool.
#
# See sidekiq.conf for how to manage a single Sidekiq instance.
#
# Use "stop sidekiq_workers_app" to stop all Sidekiq instances.
# Use "start sidekiq_workers_app" to start all instances.
# Use "restart sidekiq_workers_app" to restart all instances.
# Crazy, right?
